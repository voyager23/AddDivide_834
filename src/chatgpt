Therefore, for any integer values of k, the expression is exactly divisible by (n + m) when:

    n = 0 and m = 0
    n = -k/2 and m = -1, where k is an integer.
    
To find the values of n and m for which the expression (2 * n * (m + 1) + m^2 + m) / 2 is exactly divisible by (n + m), we can set up an equation and solve for the variables.

Let's write the equation based on the division with remainder:

(2 * n * (m + 1) + m^2 + m) = k * (n + m)

Where:

    k is an integer representing the quotient

We want to find the values of n and m that satisfy this equation.

Expanding the left side of the equation:

2 * n * m + 2 * n + m^2 + m = k * n + k * m

Rearranging terms:

2 * n * m - k * n + 2 * n - k * m + m^2 + m = 0

Now, let's group the terms:

(n * (2 * m - k) + (2 * n - k * m) + m^2 + m = 0

For this equation to hold true, the coefficients of each variable (n and m) and the constant term must be zero.

Equating the coefficients to zero, we have:

2 * m - k = 0 ...(1)
2 * n - k * m = 0 ...(2)
m^2 + m = 0 ...(3)

Solving equation (3), we find two possible solutions for m: m = 0 and m = -1.

If m = 0, substituting into equation (2), we have:
2 * n - k * 0 = 0
2 * n = 0
n = 0

If m = -1, substituting into equation (2), we have:
2 * n - k * (-1) = 0
2 * n + k = 0
2 * n = -k
n = -k/2

Therefore, for any integer values of k, the expression is exactly divisible by (n + m) when:

    n = 0 and m = 0
    n = -k/2 and m = -1, where k is an integer.

Note that if n = 0 and m = 0, the denominator (n + m) would be zero, which is undefined in arithmetic. 
So, the valid solution is n = -k/2 and m = -1 for integer values of k.
